# Drone_navigation_In_ForestType_env_depthCamera
Drone navigation in a forest-type environment, where the drone detects gaps between tree trunks and passes through them. If an obstacle blocks the path, the drone applies the Velocity Obstacle (VO) method to avoid it and move safely. If no trees are detected for a certain number of frames, the drone initiates landing.
